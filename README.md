# Deep-Learning (Modern Machine Learning)
Deep Artificial Neural Network for predicting student performance [UCI Repo Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance?ref=datanews.io). The experimental work in this repo intends to extend on my previous Master's research on Machine Learning [Evaluating AdaBoost, 2015](http://kudzai.xyz/download/Kudzai_Huni_-_Final_Version.pdf) for predecting student performance. This time, let's do it the Deep-Learning way!   Â¯\\_\_(ãƒ„)_\_/Â¯

## Model Accuracy ðŸ¤—
With a very small dataset the aspect of accuracy can be concerning. However, Currently the model is "close to accurate", but can be further improved with additional techniques such as parameter-tunning, cleaning out outliers from the dataset, fitting the right number of hidden layers to the model/classifier etc...

The training accuracy was 100%, but the test accuracy was 85%... Now, one would wonder what happened? ðŸ¤” Why such a 15% difference/discrepancy in accuracy? ðŸ¤” Small Dataset? ðŸ¤” Needs further Parameter Tuning? ðŸ¤” Too many/little Hidden Layers? ðŸ¤” Overfitting? ðŸ¤” Underfitting? ðŸ¤” This is exactly what makes Deep Neural Nets fun right? ðŸ¤£

# Part-1 of 2
Part-1 & Part-2 are exactly the same except that Part-1 utilises high-level abstraction frameworks such as a combination of Keras & Tensorflow. Part-2 involves lower-level abstraction frameworks such as a combination of Numpy & Tensorflow.

Part-2 dives deeper into most of the interesting mathmatics that happen behind the scenes, whereas in Part-1 most of the mathematics is abstracted away from the user. Oooh ðŸ˜±, there's no fun in that, right!ðŸ˜±? No Mathematics ðŸ˜µ !!!

We love Mathematics ðŸ˜Ž... But there's a lot value in modern high level-abstraction Machine Leanring techniques for beginners & newbies.

My vision is to inspire more Software-Engineers to co-create A.I driven applications.
