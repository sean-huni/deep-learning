# deep-learning
Deep Artificial Neural Network for predicting student performance [UCI Repo Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance?ref=datanews.io). The experimental work in this repo intends to extend on my previous Master's research on Machine Learning [Evaluating AdaBoost, 2015](http://kudzai.xyz/download/Kudzai_Huni_-_Final_Version.pdf) for predecting student performance. This time, let's do it the Deep-Learning way!   Â¯\\__(ãƒ„)__/Â¯

# Part-1 of 2
Part-1 & Part-2 are exactly the same expect that Part-1 utilises high-level abstraction frameworks such as a combination of Keras & Tensorflow, and Part-2 involves lower-level abstraction frameworks such as a combination of Numpy & Tensorflow.

Part-2 dives deeper into most of the interesting mathmatics that happen behind the scenes, whereas in Part-1 most of the mathematics is abstracted away from the user. Oooh ðŸ˜±, there's no fun in that! No Mathematics ðŸ˜µ !!!

I love Mathematics ðŸ˜Ž...
